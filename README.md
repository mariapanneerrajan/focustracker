- **TypeScript** - Type-safe JavaScript
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first CSS framework
- **Mobile-first design** - Optimized for mobile devices

### Backend
- **Python** - Backend development language
- **REST API** - Communication protocol between frontend and backend
- **Firebase Database** - Cloud-based NoSQL database for data storage

### Authentication
- **Google Firebase** - User authentication and authorization

### Architecture
- **Separation of Concerns** - Frontend and backend as separate, independent services
- **RESTful Communication** - Clean API interface between services

## üéØ Core Features
