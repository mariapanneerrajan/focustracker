## 🏛 Architecture Patterns & Abstraction Strategy

### Service Abstraction Implementation
- **Repository Pattern** - Abstract data access layer from business logic
- **Adapter Pattern** - Wrap third-party services (Firebase, Supabase) with consistent interfaces
- **Factory Pattern** - Create service instances based on configuration
- **Dependency Injection** - Inject dependencies rather than hard-coding implementations
- **Strategy Pattern** - Allow runtime switching between different service implementations

### Third-Party Service Migration Strategy
- **Configuration-Based Switching** - Use environment variables to select service implementations
- **Interface Compliance** - All adapters must implement the same interfaces
- **Data Migration Tools** - Create utilities to migrate data between services
- **Feature Parity Testing** - Ensure all adapters provide equivalent functionality
- **Gradual Migration Support** - Support running multiple services simultaneously during migration

### Example Service Interfaces
```typescript
// Frontend Authentication Interface
interface IAuthService {
  signIn(email: string, password: string): Promise<User>;
  signUp(email: string, password: string): Promise<User>;
  signOut(): Promise<void>;
  getCurrentUser(): Promise<User | null>;
  onAuthStateChanged(callback: (user: User | null) => void): () => void;
}

// Backend Repository Interface
interface ISessionRepository {
  create(session: CreateSessionDto): Promise<Session>;
  findByUserId(userId: string, date?: string): Promise<Session[]>;
  findById(id: string): Promise<Session | null>;
  update(id: string, updates: Partial<Session>): Promise<Session>;
  delete(id: string): Promise<void>;
  getStatistics(userId: string, days: number): Promise<Statistics>;
}
```

## 📋 Development Best Practices

### Code Quality

- Use dependency injection consistently across all service layers
- Implement proper abstraction layers for ALL third-party dependencies
- Follow RESTful API design principles with service-agnostic implementations
- Use design patterns appropriately (Repository, Adapter, Factory, Strategy)

### Testing Strategy
- Write tests before implementation (TDD)
- Include unit, integration, and e2e tests
- Test error scenarios and edge cases
- Maintain test documentation
- Automate test execution in CI/CD pipeline

This comprehensive plan ensures a robust, scalable, and maintainable Focus Tracker application that meets all specified requirements while following industry best practices.
