# Focus Tracker - Development Implementation Plan

## üìã Overview

This document outlines a comprehensive step-by-step plan to implement the Focus Tracker application based on the requirements specified in README.md. The plan follows SOLID principles, clean architecture, and test-driven development practices.

**Key Principle: Every phase produces working, testable software that can be used, tested, and reviewed.**

The plan is structured to build the backend first with complete functionality before moving to the frontend. Each phase delivers a working increment that can be independently tested and validated.

## üèõ Architecture Patterns & Abstraction Strategy

### Service Abstraction Implementation
- **Repository Pattern** - Abstract data access layer from business logic
- **Adapter Pattern** - Wrap third-party services (Firebase, Supabase) with consistent interfaces
- **Factory Pattern** - Create service instances based on configuration
- **Dependency Injection** - Inject dependencies rather than hard-coding implementations
- **Strategy Pattern** - Allow runtime switching between different service implementations

### Third-Party Service Migration Strategy
- **Configuration-Based Switching** - Use environment variables to select service implementations
- **Interface Compliance** - All adapters must implement the same interfaces
- **Data Migration Tools** - Create utilities to migrate data between services
- **Feature Parity Testing** - Ensure all adapters provide equivalent functionality
- **Gradual Migration Support** - Support running multiple services simultaneously during migration

### Example Service Interfaces
```typescript
// Frontend Authentication Interface
interface IAuthService {
  signIn(email: string, password: string): Promise<User>;
  signUp(email: string, password: string): Promise<User>;
  signOut(): Promise<void>;
  getCurrentUser(): Promise<User | null>;
  onAuthStateChanged(callback: (user: User | null) => void): () => void;
}

// Backend Repository Interface
interface ISessionRepository {
  create(session: CreateSessionDto): Promise<Session>;
  findByUserId(userId: string, date?: string): Promise<Session[]>;
  findById(id: string): Promise<Session | null>;
  update(id: string, updates: Partial<Session>): Promise<Session>;
  delete(id: string): Promise<void>;
  getStatistics(userId: string, days: number): Promise<Statistics>;
}
```

### Code Quality
- Follow SOLID principles in all implementations, especially Dependency Inversion
- Maintain high test coverage (>90%) including abstraction layer tests
- Use TypeScript strictly with no `any` types, define proper interfaces
- Follow consistent code formatting and linting rules
- Implement proper error handling throughout all abstraction layers

### Architecture
- Maintain clear separation between layers (View, Controller, Model, Adapter)
- Use dependency injection consistently across all service layers
- Implement proper abstraction layers for ALL third-party dependencies
- Follow RESTful API design principles with service-agnostic implementations
- Use design patterns appropriately (Repository, Adapter, Factory, Strategy)

### Testing Strategy
- Write tests before implementation (TDD)
- Include unit, integration, and e2e tests
- Test error scenarios and edge cases
- Maintain test documentation
- Automate test execution in CI/CD pipeline

## üîë Key Development Principles

### Working Software at Every Step
- **Every phase produces working, testable software** that can be independently validated
- **Clear checkpoints** with specific test commands to verify functionality
- **Incremental delivery** allows for early feedback and course correction
- **Risk mitigation** through early validation of core functionality

### Backend-First Approach Benefits
- **API-driven development** ensures clear contracts between frontend and backend
- **Independent testing** of business logic without UI complexity
- **Parallel frontend development** possible once backend APIs are stable
- **Clear separation of concerns** between data/logic layer and presentation layer

### Quality Assurance Throughout
- **Test-driven development** with comprehensive test coverage at each phase
- **Continuous integration** with automated testing and validation
- **Performance validation** at each checkpoint to prevent technical debt
- **Security validation** throughout development, not just at the end

### SOLID Principles Application
- **Single Responsibility**: Each service/component has one clear purpose
- **Open/Closed**: Services are extensible through interfaces without modification
- **Liskov Substitution**: All service implementations are interchangeable
- **Interface Segregation**: Small, focused interfaces prevent unnecessary dependencies  
- **Dependency Inversion**: Depend on abstractions, not concrete implementations

This comprehensive plan ensures a robust, scalable, and maintainable Focus Tracker application that meets all specified requirements while following industry best practices and delivering working software at every step.
